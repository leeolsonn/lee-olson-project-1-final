            <h2> about the founder</h2>
            <p>David's love for coffee began, like most people, in college. Being an arts major he spent many night up until 4am working all of his drawings for class. Coffee was his greatest companion during these sleepness nights, in which he tried a multitude of differnt brews, roasts, and flavors. It was actually one night at 4am that he developed that idea for Jaded Coffee Co. A company that ships coffee directly to students who are too busy finishing the 10,000th perspective drawing to go out and buy the coffee for themselves. The name Jaded Coffee Co. actually came to David after he recieved the grade back from his latest drawing assignment, he could feel the moment he went from positive young student to a jaded adult just trying to trudge through life.
